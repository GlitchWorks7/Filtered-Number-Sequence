# FilteredNumberSequence
This program creates a sequence of numbers is a spacific way depending on user input.
For example: if a user inputs the number 3, then the only number that can be used are the numbers, 1, 2, and 3. You will start at 111 and count up, 112, 113 but once your at 113 and the next number would be 114 well that would be right but sence the rules say you cannot use 4 then the next higher number is 121 and it continues counting untill its reached 333 and sence it can't go any higher, it stops and makes a file with all the numbers.
For the number 4 you start at 1111 and can only use 1, 2, 3 and 4. and so on for as big as a number you want.


Warning: The higher number of a number you put the longer it will take and the more storage the output file will be.
